# GitHub
 
For this lab, we practiced using Git, a software for distributed version control. We downloaded the GitHub Desktop software and followed the tutorial to set up a repository. Through this process, we learned how to add our Arduino files to the repository, enabling efficient version control. Git allows us to track changes, manage revisions, and seamlessly merge branches when needed, ensuring a smooth and organized workflow.
